**The code sample is a Work In Progress (WIP).**

It is intented for the sole purpose of illustratring how to implement the suggested solution so that the [Dynamics 365](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/) Biz Apps portals, the [Power Pages](https://powerpages.microsoft.com/) websites, formely Power Apps portals, as well as [Azure AD B2C](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/active-directory/external-identities/b2c/#overview), can smoothly as possible integrate with the FranceConnect Platform (FCP) from a service provider (SP) perspective.

# Knwon Limitations

This code sample is thus **NOT PRODUCTION READY** as its name indicates. 

Furthermore, as far as the resulting service is concerned for one of the above-mentioned Microsoft offerings, it will NOT necessarly fully comply with ALL the aspects of the [FC specification for SP](https://partenaires.franceconnect.gouv.fr/fcp/fournisseur-service), and the related rules that accompany them for the FC technical and functional acceptance. 

One should stress that the FC team has set up a process to request the qualification of the resulting service. You should submit a request so that it can be studied and processed. Please refer to this process available at https://www.demarches-simplifiees.fr/commencer/demande-qualification-fs.
