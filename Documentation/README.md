# About the documentation of the FranceConnect Facade (FCF) code sample

**The guide is a Work In Progress (WIP).**

# About the "Getting Started" guide for FranceConnect Facade (FCF) code sample
This document [Getting Started with FranceConnect Facade (FCF)](https://github.com/microsoft/franceconnect-facade-dotnet-webapp-aspnetcore/blob/main/Documentation/Getting%20Started%20with%20FranceConnect%20Facade%20(FCF).docx), as its title implicitly suggests, takes you and guides you through all the steps required to prepare a suitable local development environment, to deploy and set all the needed resources in the Azure Cloud for the production environment, as well as a Microsoft Power Pages site, etc. to ultimately configure and test the FranceConnect Façade (FCF) [code sample](https://github.com/microsoft/franceconnect-facade-dotnet-webapp-aspnetcore/tree/main/Source) with the expected user experience (UX). This notably covers and discuss the integration of the so-called FranceConnect button.

# About the dedicated Azure AD B2C guide for FranceConnect Facade (FCF) code sample
This document [Leveraging the FranceConnect Facade (FCF) with Azure AD B2C](https://github.com/microsoft/franceconnect-facade-dotnet-webapp-aspnetcore/blob/main/Documentation/Leveraging%20the%20FranceConnect%20Facade%20(FCF)%20withAzure%20AD%20B2C.docx), as its title indicates, walks you through all the steps required to extend your development environment with an Azure AD B2C tenant, to deploy and configure suitable B2C user flows and custom policies, etc. to test the FranceConnect Façade (FCF) [code sample](https://github.com/microsoft/franceconnect-facade-dotnet-webapp-aspnetcore/tree/main/Source) in such a context with expected user experiences (UX) incorporating the FranceConnect button. The integration of a Microsoft Power Pages site as a B2C client application is also covered.

With this knowledge, you should be able to further adapt the provided code if needed to accommodate your own specific situation and/or target a specific deployment in your production environment whatever it is.
